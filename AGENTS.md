# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `README.md` holds the top-level index of preserved learning resources.
- Reference assets (PDF/EPUB) are stored in `.assets/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
A TOC is kept up to date by a local command that is run on commit.
- check that `core.hooksPath` is set to `.githooks`. If not prompt the user to install the hook

## Content & Attribution
- Preserve original authorship: include source links in `README.md` and store archival copies in `.assets/` when appropriate.
- Prefer minimal edits to referenced materials; document any changes or formatting adjustments alongside the entry.
