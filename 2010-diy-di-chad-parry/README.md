# About this version DIY-DI

This small article was a reference piece in the 2010's, as it proved how easy it is to do manual DI without being confused by the "magic" of the fancy IOC frameworks, so I thought it should be more easily accessible.

Chad's [original blog entry](https://blacksheep.parry.org/archives/diy-di) is still online, with all files, but in case it goes down I saved a copy of the [original pdf](../.assets/2010-chad-parry-DIY-DI.pdf).

## Improvements on the original
For easier viewing, the possibility of creating HTML and epub versions, I 
- created a [Markdown version](./DIY_DI.md) of the pdf and an associated `./create-html-version.sh` script
- created an [EPUB](../.assets/DIY_DI.epub) of the HTML from that Markdown
- extracted the code examples and added a Maven build to be able to smoothly check out the source files in your IDE
