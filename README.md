# Learning Resources

These are some of the resources that I find stands the test of time,
typically deeply influencing me at some point and/or standing as great 
reference pieces that are worth revisiting in a world filled with constant flux.

After 15 years, I have seen how many of my favorite articles and resources 
have started vanishing, and so I thought I would save the ones I could, trying to
attribute the original owner as best I could.

To check out these articles, start with the [index](./Index.md).
